@dandrezner @EricRWeinstein @washingtonpost to make this point it would only be sensible to show when he said, it was all new When talking to people and asking them to read your work words like, like, and  to call their work cute as simple as I can make it, patronising, self absorbed, to the point of arrogance and not new.

@ThomasSowell Im always confused that conservatives proclaim government as useless, but insist on it being tasked with war and nuclear weapon holding. When conservatism can bypass this political brick wall we all can move together, in keeping with constitutional rights of ppl and free markets

@chrisdelia humans are a sociable species, like wealth and standing, showing that youre a good person is more important than just being. More important than that it is accepted, applauded and reciporacated in kind.

@sullydish @benshapiro this is as obvious to me as the idea that what he said was inspired and sensational to its progressive counterparts. i didnt see a set of prose that whipped my senses adrift with hightened incredulity i stuck to my own opinion. i saw all the holes dodged all the traps

@ThomasSowell Would a commercial private company be better at making persons educted or profit, or would it maybe do a bit of a zigzag between both?
