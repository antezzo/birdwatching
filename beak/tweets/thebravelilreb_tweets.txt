@timbump67 @OleMissEvie I’d had 3 watermelon mimosas last night when I came across this post. 😣 Had to read them all again to remember what I said! 😂

@Smoke3x @OleMissEvie I know TJ told me once he went on a bama &amp; state blocking spree! 😆 Tj &amp; I were just texting about it. He said the difference with me and most, I can see right from wrong and I will say it is wrong no matter who I stand with. I guess that’s the Rebel in me. 😎

@OleMissEvie I had no idea he was a State fan when he followed me. 😑 I usually stop that before it has a chance to start! 🙅🏼‍♀️

@C35H60Br2N2O4 @OleMissEvie By all means...when I block you, don’t feel as if you just won a debate. I was captain of my debate team &amp; my teacher said there wasn’t a person in the state that could hang with me. I’m blocking you cuz you’re being a dick about my friend &amp; before i get real ugly, you gotta go.

@C35H60Br2N2O4 @OleMissEvie That wasn’t @ me...🤷🏼‍♀️ Maybe he voices his opinions on Twitter more than fb. I’m a little more careful on Facebook too as that’s where my closest friends and family are. Including my mama!

@C35H60Br2N2O4 @OleMissEvie I’ve never heard him say or seen him type an ugly word.  Always respectful in front of me like a true southern gentleman. 🤷🏼‍♀️

@C35H60Br2N2O4 @OleMissEvie I have a hard time imagining him losing a debate! I’m reading a transcript for one of his novels now and it’s incredible! I’m honored he sent it to me to get my opinion!
