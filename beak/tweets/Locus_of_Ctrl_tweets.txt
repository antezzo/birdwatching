@phl43 @thespandrell A more simple hypothesis is that the Turkic takeover of Eurasian steppes followed a brain/brawn drain of Iranics into Europe and Middle East.

@HalifaxShadow It's good to see them reasoning through their own system of so-called privilege and bringing it to its logical conclusion though.

@17cShyteposter This leads me to wonder on the role of eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty, but can't find a good source...

@17cShyteposter People laugh when the SJWs mention "lived experience," but very often it is "experts" and their allies who have no "lived experience" of being a parent who get ahead in a system that tends to benefit those who postpone child-rearing and who then become our "ideologues."

@Lostincare @janeparenting2 @DeanneCarson The educational system is inherently biased to work in favor of "experts" who don't have children (due to stress/time involved in completing degrees etc). The experts, consequently, have no "lived experience" of what it means to be a parent.

@Lostincare @janeparenting2 @DeanneCarson The system may be very unjust (or not), but since nearly all social-justice literature tends to be written by those very experts, there is an inherent epistemic problem in knowing whether the State engages in this graft or not.

@Lostincare @janeparenting2 @DeanneCarson Depending on how one looks at this, the system becomes a kind of large-scale graft that keeps the flock of experts employed at a dubious cost to the society at large (since no long-term experiments have been done almost by definition).
