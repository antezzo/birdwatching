@patrickgaley Lol stay home away from the border and there would be no scenes. Unfortunately all these people are terrorists and if they touch the fence they get shot. If they try to destroy the fence so they can cross, they get shot. End of story

@Ameise1971 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FoxBusiness How do you figure Jews have not been willing to share? The biggest area of the old city is Moslem with their Moseque on top of temple mount! Christians have their Churches as well wherever they want. But guess what There are NO Synagogues in the Moslem neighborhood without guards

@Ameise1971 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FoxBusiness I repeat. Why was there no peace in 1948 or 1967? Jews did not have Jerusalem or the West Bank at the time. Why did they attack us?
