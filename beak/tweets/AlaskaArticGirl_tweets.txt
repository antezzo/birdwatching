@asimmonsflorida GOD BLESS YOU, I have so enjoyed talking about our dads. He was my life. It has softened some of the wounds for me, I never talk about it to my husband, he came from non military family &amp; does not really understand BUT you do. THANK YOU for this, a good cry was good today. https://t.co/67MZybG0ij

@asimmonsflorida It takes AMAZING men to sacrifice a safe life for the Military. My dad always said we fight them there so they don't come here. I never understood BUT now I do. My mother was never the same, she said I looked just like him, she could not deal w/it.

@asimmonsflorida The guys in my dads squadron really got me thru it, there is no closure, no body , really never know what happened, you just accept it. When I would ask they just said lets not talk about it, it only brought bad memories to them also. I have a flight suit, his medals, few pics.

@Lenworth7 Gotta grow my food so I can eat. Food is expensive here in Alaska, it has to be trucked or ferried in. So I grow mine. I am 100% self supported way out here in No where of Alaska. https://t.co/EmtbcO0akQ
