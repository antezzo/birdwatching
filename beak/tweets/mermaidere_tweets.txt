@irithyllians She has no idea. Her mother (a midlander Hyur) kept the identity of her father very under the wraps and just a big secret. But a lot of the stories she was told make it seem like so.

Coincidentally, I also have no idea who her dad is. I know who her daddy is, though.

Victorine is a character who tags along with the WoL, trying to stick her nose into the Empire to find out who her father is, pulls an Anna Anderson when it comes to Big Papa Varis. 

(This was all because I put her last name as Varis when I made her — I DIDN'T KNOW, OK).
