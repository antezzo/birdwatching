@bluecentric @theGrio This is Kim Kardashian crap. She says she's not a feminist. Practices an aesthetics of empowerment that gets stuff from feminism but understands nothing about it, but also isn't participating in a social movement in any way.

@bluecentric @theGrio There's a difference between Stanton and all excluding black church women and black women's club, or the Women's March organizers ignoring activist of color, and, say, Kim Kardashian.

@bluecentric @theGrio Of course I know this history. But every time a white woman does something shady or racist, it does not mean she's a feminist. If someone says "I'm not a feminist" (which she has done) why would I say she is?

So much for "Defend the oppressed." (Isaiah 1:17). Preaching social justice is 'evil,' a Southern Baptist pastor in Texas says https://t.co/tlSNKXIOdT

@bluecentric @theGrio She isn't a feminist. I just think it is responsible to note that.

@bluecentric @theGrio Part of anti-feminism is using important feminist rhetoric as aesthetics. And I will continue to draw the comparison even though you don't like it--people do this with the black folks too. Important, in fact, issues of life and death, become mere entertainment.

@bluecentric @theGrio I am black and a feminist, so I don't think it is disrespectful. In fact, I teach black feminism. I generally agree with your work. I just want the work of feminism--from all different kinds of people--to be more clearly articulated.

@bluecentric--just because she's a white woman does not mean she's a feminist. She has a video going after feminism. It's like saying "this is the problem with fighting for black liberation" when a black person commits a crime. https://t.co/gGfA8qj61a via @theGrio
