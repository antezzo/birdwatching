@FoxNews President Obama and the Democrats gave the "illusion" of good times. But it was a total con job. I've undergone 12 brain surgeries, face challenges. Bringing tons of illegal immigrants here pushes down wages, pushes up rents. Trump is 100% doing what's best for Americans.

@jfd998 @rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel I authored this blog 4 years ago following a revelation. It was initially religious in content. But I later revised it to make it more mainstream &amp; cited the popular book on change. It's now more neuroscience of change and our relationship w God. https://t.co/8bgIlZ6Gkp

@jfd998 @rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel And they are receiving lots of fuel &amp; support, and unknowing young people via social media are swept up in this false god of political power. Progressive leaders (free thinkers) also use Islam in this war on Christianity. But what I don't yet know is WHY now? Critical times!

@jfd998 @rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel A year ago or so I began researching "free thinkers" (which during the 1970s I kind of embraced). But that movement today is a rekindling of the 3000 yr war on Judao Christian teachings, and progressives seek to supplant Christianity with their new gov &amp; science platform.

@jfd998 @rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel But that's where women's rights movement has gone (my opinion) pushing it to the ridiculous. I think the progressive movement is a rekindling of the 3000 yr biblical war, w social media, disrespect of accepted teachings &amp; brain wave entrainment being used to create upheaval.

@rachaeleelmy @jfd998 @inthelineofmel Women's rights to my understanding (of terminology) was the original movement. But I feel it has been hijacked of late by the more progressive sexual identity movement. I suspect they all have their unique terms. But for many of us, it appears blurred into one movement.

@jfd998 @rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel Humans have so much bias, and a brain that is far from evolved, that we can easily be tricked or misled. I work with brain wave entrainment in drum circles, and use it in very healthy positive ways. But this science is largely how perpetrators use magic, trickery, and deception.

@inthelineofmel A devout Christian friend had come by Sat Eve to play music, and again shared her doubts on evolution of man, saying that 500k years would have allowed more evolving of our brains for issue of today. And I agreed with her. Later, after she left, I had the two Revelations.

@rachaeleelmy @inthelineofmel There of issues regarding women's equality, then there is the movement surrounding sexual identity. And it appears the two are swept up in the same storm of progressive change.
