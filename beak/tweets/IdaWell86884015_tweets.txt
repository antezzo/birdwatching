@ofTimeSpace @StitchASvGHeart @bossassbutera @catapstrophe Greasy, my brain DEFINITELY works differently. And I take back the credit I gave you. You, too are too stupid to know you're being manipulated. Should've never even given you that credit, hell you're Canadian.

@StitchASvGHeart Since I don't know the definition, are you or aren't you? You're the liar. See how all this works? I keep playing you, you keep getting played, and your stupidity is ever more apparent with each twat.

@StitchASvGHeart You'll be an ex-bully in Leavenworth. They don't like cops in prison. And your career path is leading you straight there. I guess since your parents were smart enough to kick your ass out, they'll be able to raise your kid for you. But if you're any indication of their ability,ðŸ˜³

@StitchASvGHeart @bossassbutera @ofTimeSpace @catapstrophe Preciate It! You are a TEXTBOOK bully. OBVIOUSLY why you're a cop. You're a cop in the military because if your low ASVAB score, and because your parents said you had to get your pregnant high school ass out of their house and get a job doing SOMETHING....

@StitchASvGHeart YOU'RE a bully. You're NOT bullying me. You're a dike, apparently, but you're not diking me. You do know that high schools basically give out diplomas for just showing up. Of course you don't; there's that low ASVAB again...

@StitchASvGHeart @ofTimeSpace @catapstrophe @bossassbutera Based on your personality, I would've assumed that was a picture of your mother....
