It's Faye, I'm drawing Faye. I can't blame you if you didn't figure it out, considering she only appears as a wrapped dead body, a bag of ash and a old painting on a mural.

I wanted to try drawing her because of mother's day, so here's a little sketch. I'll try coloring it later

@VertGreen_Heart I guess most people like her because of how cheerful she is, and also because of Purple Heart (Which has a shit-ton of good lewds too).

As for me, I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out which character is my favorite as of late.

@AirisuBaka How about a drawing of her laying facedown on the beach? Her top off and her hair brushed sideways to let that strong back get nice and tanned.
