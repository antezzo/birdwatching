also, for some, just the thought of seeing a *person* for your anxiety can trigger your anxiety, starting first with an AI and then moving on to a human therapist later on could be life changing for some. https://t.co/i9UHBIAEeM

@flibblesan nope, at least the TicWatch 2 doesnt, runs their own custom android ROM, called Ticwear, surprisingly nice and stable tbf, nicer for me at least than wearOS

@flibblesan i have a similar thing with my TicWatch, except its just Qi, but ther Qi charger has some sort of higher speed charging or something, becasue standard Qi chargers only get about halfway before the watch heats up too much and stops itself from charging

first print on glass bed is going well. wish i were big enough to get sponsored for stuff, though, more consistent uploads would help that. Either way, in a little while, i should get some Wolfbite Nano in, and im excited to try it out
